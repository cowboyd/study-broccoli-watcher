In order to integrate broccoli with karma, I need to know more about
how the watcher works. Unfortunately, there is very little to go on
with regards to documentation. There is no API documentation, and
watcher source file itself contains code only. I have several
questions about it because it looks like I'll need to instantiate one
directly in order to integrate it with karma. I've decided to document
this micro-research so that others, myself included may reap some
small benefit from it in the future.

### What does the broccoli callback interface look like?

From the what I've seen in other projects and what it looks like from
a source dive, it supports a promise-like API. E.g:

```javascript
var Watcher = require('broccoli/watcher');
var watcher = new Watcher(getBuilder())
watcher.then(function() {
  //do stuff?
});
```

Do I need to re-register and re-register a promise callback every time?

Actually looking into the source, it appears that the
[watcher emits events on `change` and on `error`](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli/blob/9923afe8f7c9ad7a05b5ebaf9a3233114214fdcd/lib/watcher.js#L52-L54). Is
that how I'm supposed to use it? Seems more likely. Let's give it a try.

To get started, I'll make a sample directory to watch with a single
file called sample/touch.me

and then a brocfile that builds `sample`.

It looks like the `Watcher` constructor takes a `builder` object. Not
sure what that is, but looking at the
[implementation in broccoli/cli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli/blob/97585400e0babc1b33721fb2337ed9ded55f74fa/lib/cli.js#L61-L64),
it appears that a builder is some transformation on a brocfile.

What is this `loadBrocfile()`? [I found it here](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli/blob/21a778ed1d74c4321f9bdc596b7f5081868420d3/lib/index.js#L3), which means that it [is
actually defined here](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli/blob/21a778ed1d74c4321f9bdc596b7f5081868420d3/lib/builder.js#L89-L112). I'd
thought to try and get away with not having a brocfile, like be able
to specify which file to load, but it appears that it is hard-coded to
`Brocfile.js`, but it looks like from
[these lines](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli/blob/21a778ed1d74c4321f9bdc596b7f5081868420d3/lib/builder.js#L101-L102)
 that requiring the brocfile ought to return a function always?
 Because it appears to invoke that function with the broccoli module
 as an argument. Not really sure what that's about. Is that a
 node/commonjs thing, or a Broccoli thing? Since this is
 about the Watcher, I won't delve into that.

That said, my Brocfile will look like this:

```js
module.exports = 'sample'
```

And I'll preconfigure my watcher so that I can re-use it in my
various scripts:

`watcher.js`:
```javascript
var broccoli = require('broccoli');
var Watcher = require('broccoli/lib/watcher');

var tree = broccoli.loadBrocfile();
var builder = new broccoli.Builder(tree);
module.exports = new Watcher(builder);
```

`experiments/event-api.js`
```javascript
var watcher = require('../watcher');
watcher.on('change', function(hash) {
  console.log('change', JSON.stringify(hash));
});
```

Now I'll start up the watcher.

```
$ node experiments/event-api.js                                                                                                                                       â—¼
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":0,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
```

Cool! That was actually easier to get working than I expected.

The first thing I was suprised to see was that it fired the change
event immediately. It makes total sense upon reflection, after all,
you do want to get notification about the completion of the initial
build, but it did suprise me because the word 'change' implies some
sort of transition from the initial state. Naming the event
`on('build')` might be less confusing.

So now, if I run the touch me script in that directory will it
indicate a change?

```
$ sample/touch.me
```

Yup! Just as expected:

```
$ node experiments/event-api.js
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":0,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":1,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
```

What about adding a file?:

```
$ touch sample/another.file
```

blammo!

```
$ node experiments/event-api.js
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":0,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":1,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":2,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
```

And if I remove that file?

```
$ rm sample/another.file
```

It's almost as if it were designed for this :)

```
$ node experiments/event-api.js
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":0,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":1,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":2,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
CHANGE: {"directory":"sample","graph":{"id":3,"description":"String","subtrees":[],"selfTime":0,"totalTime":0},"totalTime":0}
```



### How do I stop watching?

### What is the addWatchDir thing about. Is it a public API?
